<!--
    asynchronous javascript is basically just a fancy term 
// for some code that keeps running in the background while our main code is still executing 
// And typically that is for stuff like requesting some data
// from a remote server, like an API 
--> 

<!--
    synchronous javascript, I mean that all the instructions 
    are executed one after the other, line by line.
-->

<!--
    In order to add some asynchronous code here we are going to use the setTimeout function,
    which is basically to set a timer in JavaScript.
    And that will then allow us to write code, that should be executed later, okay?
    So that is asynchronous JavaScript
