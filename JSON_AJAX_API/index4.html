    <title>Session Storage JSON</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--
        We are going to saving some json data as string into the session storage 
        and then picking that information back up and outputting it into our web application
        and we are going to also be parsing that json on string and putting it into a readable format.

        The idea is that once we submit the form then we are going to save it into the session storage
        and we are going to turn it to json format and that's what we are going to save a string of field 
        version of it. We are going to pull that string of field version out whenever the page loads and then 
        output that content.

    <div id="output"></div>
    <form id="myForm">
        <input type="text" name="first" value="Laurence"><br>
        <input type="text" name="last" value="Svekis"><br>
        <input type="text" name="company" value="Discoveryvip"><br>

        <input type="submit" value="submit">
    </form>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var myForm = document.getElementById('myForm');

        // whenever the window loads we fire off a function  
        window.onload = function(){
            if(sessionStorage['person']!=null){
                var data = JSON.parse(sessionStorage['person']);
                var message = 'Welcome '+ data.first +''+ data.last +' to the site!!!';
                document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = message;
                console.log(data);
            }

        }
        //console.log(myForm);
        myForm.addEventListener('submit',function(e){
            e.preventDefault();// we prevent to move on other page we stay on the current .
            var data = formData(myForm);
            if(data){
                sessionStorage['person']=JSON.stringify(data);
            }
            console.log(data);
        });

        function formData(form){
            var el = form.querySelectorAll('input[type="text"]');
            var myData = {};
            for(var x=0; x<el.length; x++){
                var name = el[x].name;
                var value = el[x].value;
                console.log(name,value);
                myData[name] = value;
            }
            return el;
        }
    </script>
    <!--
        In the next stage we are gonna submitting this as a session variable as just ones variable 
        so we don't have different values for each one of these form inputs. We can have it all in 
        one chunk which offer us a lot of flexibility in our form as possible.

        Now we need to strinify this so that we can store it into our session storage. There's a number
        of places that we can do this. We can do it within this event listener. We can do it within 
        the form data. We just keep the formData as it is because what this is doing is a useful function
        that we can use in a number of other applications so we can reuse this type of functionality
        where we are returning back our form information. So esssentially returning it back as a data 
        object we can make use of it.

        Whenever the page is load we want to pull that information out of our session storage.
