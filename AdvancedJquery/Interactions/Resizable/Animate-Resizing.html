    <!-- There are three option you can use the animate , animate duration and animate issing 
         With the effect we can't see the effect instantly, but after some period of time
         animateDuration is the animation in which the animation should get complete and the values you again set for animate duration 
         are slow, fast or even a number in milliseconds 
         the default value of animateDuration is slow actually
         One more option is animateEasing and is the speed in which the animation should get completed.
         for example linear means that will happen with the same speed from the start to end
         One other is easeOutBounce, easeInOutBack
         The value of animateEasing is swing by default!!!
