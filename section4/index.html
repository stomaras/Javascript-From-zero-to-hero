<!-- In javaScript we have two big types of values, primitives and objects 

---- Primitives: 1) Numbers
                 2) Strings
                 3) Booleans
                 4) Undefined
                 5) Null
---- Everything else: 1) Arrays
                      2) Functions
                      3) Objects
                      4) Dates
                      5) Wrappers for Numbers,
                         Strings, Booleans
---- IS AN OBJECT 

---- In JavaScript objects are not just for storing a bunch of data like we have been doing 
     but for really complex things under the surface 
     Everything is an Object in JavaScript because it's one of the fundamental things 
     that makes javaScript so unique and different from other popular programming languages
     
--- OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 

    Objects interacting with one another through methods and properties;
    
    Used to store data, structure applications into modules and keeping code clean.

    The classes in javaScript are called as COSTRUCTOR or PROTOTYPE and based on the prototype
    we can create as many instances as we want 
    So for example from the Person Constructor i can create Instances as jane, mark, John

---- Inheritance ----

    In Simple terms inheritance is when one object is based on another object , it's when one object
    get access to another object's properties and methods.
    So very Simple 

    Back to our persons example, imagine that you also wanted to have an athlete constructor 
    besides the person constructor with a couple of different properties and methods

    Person: name
            yearOfBirth
            job
            calculateAge()
            
    Athlete: olympics
             olympicMedals
             allowedOlympics()

    Now an athlete is also a person ... there are just some particular properties and methods
    for an athlete, like for example how many participations in Olympics they have or how many medals
    they have won. With inheritance we make the Athlete Object inherit the properties and methods from
    the Person object, so athlete has access to his own properties but also to the objects of person 
    so Athlete becomes:

    Athlete: olympics
             olympicMedals
             allowedOlympics()
             name
             yearOfBirth
             isMarried
             calculateAge()
    
    So with this way we write more logical code and write more logical programs

    Inheritance in javaScript is made possible through the prototype property that every object has 

    Every Object that we create is an instance of the Object constructor which has a bunch of methods 

    in its prototype property.

    Prototype chain makes all the inheritance possible 

    NOTES ! ! !

    1) Every JavaScript object has a prototype property, which makes injeritance possible in JS

    2) The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want 
       other objects to inherit 

    3) The Constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the Consrtuctor itself,it's the 
       prototype of ALL instances that are created through it;
